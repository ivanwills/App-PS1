=head1 App-PS1

Sick of the boring BASH shell command prompt, want more information displayedi
L<App-PS1> does this.

It provides a nice way of addind a line sepperator for your prompt which you
can fill with various peices of information like the directory, status of the
last command and more.

The C<app-ps1> command displays the elements put into either C<$APP_PS1>
environment variable or passed with C<--ps1> parameter. The elements are
all calculated and if one more more has no content (eg branch, perl, node
or ruby) it is removed and all the rest are show. If there is too much to
display on the line (requires L<Term::Size::Any> or C<$PS1_COLS> environment
variable to be set) the elements from the right are dropped until the line
would fit.

=head1 Examples

   # in your ~/.bashrc file
   export APP_PS1='face;branch;date;direcory;perl;node;ruby;uptime'
   export PS1="\[\`app-ps1 -e\$?\`\]\n\u@\h \\\$ "
